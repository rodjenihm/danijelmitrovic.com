# Hello, World!

Welcome to my Tech Blog! I'm excited to share my journey in software development, focusing on backend technologies like Java, Spring, and cloud platforms.

<br />

Here's a classic "Hello, World!" example in Java to get us started:

```java
void main() {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

I got ya. You probably expected `public static void main(String[] args)`. Well, too bad. We are using modern Java here.

<br />

Stay tuned for more posts on Java, Spring, cloud technologies, databases, and more!
