# Hello, World!

Welcome to my new tech blog! I'm excited to share my journey in software development, focusing on backend technologies like Java, Spring, and cloud platforms.

Here's a classic "Hello, World!" example in Java to get us started:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Stay tuned for more posts on Java, cloud technologies, databases, and more!
